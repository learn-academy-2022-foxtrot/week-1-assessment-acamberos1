// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
 //console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer: I think i saw it in class but at first I thought it would send out indigo but it showed 5 
// b) Verify and explain: after running the code it returned 5 but i cant remember why


// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
//console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: I think it will show 10 i think i remember during the lectures that one of the mentors saying the space counts as a character
// b) Verify and explain: i was correct in my educated guess, after un commenting and testing the code, the number 10 was printed out


// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
 console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: my gut says it will log o since h will count as 0 I think
// b) Verify and explain: i was correct it  printed out o since it was counted as the 4th position


// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
//const index = 1
 //console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: i cant remember what index did besides be related to indicating location but i think it will either print the letter in the one position or the word in position one which i think will be ruby
// b) Verify and explain: i was correct in it printing the word ruby out with console log


// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
 //console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: I cant find it in my notes for some reason , my gut says its because it seems obvious. I think it will capitalize each first letter in the array.
// b) Verify and explain: the cli said upper case isnt a function


// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: the way they are typed out i think it will print out strings since they are in quotation marks and they havent been declared otherwise
// b) Verify and explain: it came out as number which i assume is from the const in place
